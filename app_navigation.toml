In applications like Notepad, where files are listed in a navigation pane or a file explorer, you can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through and select files. Here are some common keyboard shortcuts for file navigation:

1. **Arrow Keys:**
   - Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to navigate through the list of files.

2. **Home and End Keys:**
   - Use the **Home** key to jump to the beginning of the file list.
   - Use the **End** key to jump to the end of the file list.

3. **Letter Keys:**
   - Start typing the first few letters of the file name to jump to the first file that matches the typed letters.

4. **Page Up and Page Down Keys:**
   - Use the **Page Up** and **Page Down** keys to scroll through the file list.

5. **Tab Key:**
   - If there are multiple panes, you might need to use the **Tab** key to move between panes before using arrow keys.

6. **Enter Key:**
   - Press the **Enter** key to open or select the highlighted file.

These shortcuts should help you navigate and select files efficiently using the keyboard in applications like Notepad. Keep in mind that the specific functionality might 
vary depending on the application and its version.


Moving the mouse cursor to specific locations, such as the left pane in an application, is typically done using a combination of keyboard shortcuts or navigation commands. However, the exact method can depend on the application or 
software you're using, as different programs may have different user interfaces and accessibility features.

For general navigation:

1. **Tab Key:**
   - Press the **Tab** key to cycle through different elements on the screen, including panes and buttons. Some applications use the Tab key to move focus between panes.

2. **Arrow Keys:**
   - If the left pane is a part of a larger interface, you might be able to use the **Arrow** keys to navigate through different sections.

3. **Access Keys or Shortcuts:**
   - Some applications have specific access keys or shortcuts to navigate to different panes. These are often indicated by underlined letters in menu options. For example, pressing **Alt + the underlined letter** might activate a specific menu.

4. **Mouse Gestures:**
   - Depending on the application, you might have mouse gesture support. You could try holding down a specific mouse button (like the right mouse button) while moving the mouse in a certain direction.

It's important to note that not all applications have the same functionality, and some may not provide direct keyboard shortcuts for navigating to specific panes. If you can provide more details about the specific application you're using, I may be able to offer more targeted guidance.
